Project Difficulties:
- Setting up GitKraken 
(But not nearly as bad as the first time! I made sure this was the first thing I did)

- Making the jump, fall, landing, and spriting animations work
(This was extremely difficult for me to implement in scripts)

- Collision detection between the player and red damage cubes
(It would take some pushing for the collision to register)
