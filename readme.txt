WASD - Move
Space - Jump
Shift (hold) - Run
Left Mouse - Fire blue cube
Left Mouse (hold & release) - Drop purple cube

Project Difficulties:
- Setting up GitKraken 
(But not nearly as bad as the first time! I made sure this was the first thing I did)

- Making the jump, fall, landing, and sprinting animations work
(This was extremely difficult for me to implement in scripts)

- Collision detection between the player and red damage cubes
(Known issue; It would take some pushing for the collision to register)

- Ensuring the purple cube doesn't appear prematurely
(Known issue)
